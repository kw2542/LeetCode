Q:
  You are given a string, S, and a list of words, L, that are all of the same length. Find all starting indices of substring(s) in S that is a concatenation of each word in L exactly once and without any intervening characters.

  For example, given:
  S: "barfoothefoobarman"
  L: ["foo", "bar"]

  You should return the indices: [0,9].
  (order does not matter).

Notes:
  In CPP, [] operator performs a search again. If going to use a certain value serveral times, keep in mind that it is much efficient to use iterator. What's more, if the iterator equals end(), we have to search again after insertion.
  
  Enum all combinations of concatenations is a pain. Use a map to count the number of each word or use a set if they are all unique.
