Q:
  There are two sorted arrays A and B of size m and n respectively. Find the median of the two sorted arrays. The overall run time complexity should be O(log (m+n)).

Notes:
  Naive thought is to go through all elements but it takes O(m+n)
  How to reduce it to O(log(m+n))?
  As usually, log appear when we reduce the original program to half every time
  To find the median is to find the (m+n)/2 or value
  It is the same as find the (m+n)/4 th value if we remove the smallest (m+n)/4 elements, which is easy since both arrays are sorted.
  
  The tricky part of the implementation is we didn't remove smallest elements every time, we only need to make sure that we remove elemets smallers than the index
