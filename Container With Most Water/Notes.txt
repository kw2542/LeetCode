Q:
  Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an, where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai). n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0). Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.
  
Notes:
  This problem is fun.
  if (height[low] < height[high]) we let low = low + 1
  which means we ignored containers with low, high-1; low, high-2 ....
  This is safe because these containers cannot hold more water that low, high
  the other side is the same
  
  So, we reduce this O(n^2) problem to O(n)
