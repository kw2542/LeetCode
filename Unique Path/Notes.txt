Q:
	A robot is located at the top-left corner of a m x n grid (marked 'Start' in the diagram below).

	The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked 'Finish' in the diagram below).

	How many possible unique paths are there?
	Note: m and n will be at most 100.

Notes:
	Be care of the limit. Since m and n will be at most 100
	So the largest number in calculating the combination is C(100, 50), which is larger than 2^64
	So we have to use DP rather than combination calculation to do the job
