Q:
	Given a m x n grid filled with non-negative numbers, find a path from top left to bottom right which minimizes the sum of all numbers along its path.
	Note: You can only move either down or right at any point in time.

Notes:
	The BFS way is the generay way to find a path. However, in this problem, we can only move down or right, it is easier to use DP
