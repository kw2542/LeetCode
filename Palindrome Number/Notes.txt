Q:
  Determine whether an integer is a palindrome. Do this without extra space.

  Some hints:
    Could negative integers be palindromes? (ie, -1)
    If you are thinking of converting the integer to string, note the restriction of using extra space.
    You could also try reversing an integer. However, if you have solved the problem "Reverse Integer", you know that the reversed integer might overflow. How would you handle such case?
    There is a more generic way of solving this problem.
    
Notes:
  One way is to reverse the number, but there is a possibility that the reverse number will overflow. Storing the reverse number in long long is a solution but it might be platform dependent. More generic way is to compare the digit by digit.
