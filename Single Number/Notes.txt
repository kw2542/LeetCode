Q:
  Given an array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.
  Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?

Notes:
  The power of Bitwise operation!
  The power of XOR!
  Any same numbers results in 0 after XOR
  0 XOR any number = any number
  A XOR B XOR C = A XOR (B XOR C)
