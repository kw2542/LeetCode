Q:
  You are given two linked lists representing two non-negative numbers. The digits are stored in reverse order and each of their nodes contain a single digit. Add the two numbers and return it as a linked list.

  Input: (2 -> 4 -> 3) + (5 -> 6 -> 4)
  Output: 7 -> 0 -> 8
 
 Notes:
  It is hard to decide whether to create a new node or not if we calculate the value and assign it to the current node. So, one tricky way is to sign value to the next node!
  Actually, the Java and C++ codes are the same, but it takes Java 700+ ms to finish, almost three times than C++
