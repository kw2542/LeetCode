  Clarification:
    What constitutes a word?
      A sequence of non-space characters constitutes a word.
    
    Could the input string contain leading or trailing spaces?
      Yes. However, your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces.
    
    How about multiple spaces between two words?
      Reduce them to a single space in the reversed string.

Notes:
  C++ takes 40+ ms
  Java takes 400+ ms
  split() method takes regular expression as argument
    use "\\s+" to hadle sequential white spaces
  trim() method returns a copy of string with leading and trailing white spaces removed
