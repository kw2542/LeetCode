Q:
  Given a linked list, swap every two adjacent nodes and return its head.

  For example,
  Given 1->2->3->4, you should return the list as 2->1->4->3.

  Your algorithm should use only constant space. You may not modify the values in the list, only nodes itself can be changed.
  
Notes:
  Use a dummy node
  Be careful the order to swap two nodes in a list
