Q:
  Given an array S of n integers, are there elements a, b, c in S such that a + b + c = 0? Find all unique triplets in the array which gives the sum of zero.

  Note:
  Elements in a triplet (a,b,c) must be in non-descending order. (ie, a = b = c)
  The solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.
      For example, given array S = {-1 0 1 2 -1 -4},

      A solution set is:
      (-1, 0, 1)
      (-1, -1, 2)

Notes:
  There is not better solution than O(n^2)
  Improve time complexcity using pruning.
  To prune, sort the input first! Actually sorting makes the complexity of the algorithm decrease from O(n^3) to O(n^2)
