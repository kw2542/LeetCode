Q:
  Given a string S, find the longest palindromic substring in S. You may assume that the maximum length of S is 1000, and there exists one unique longest palindromic substring.
  
Notes:
  Use Dynamic Programming, if a substring from i to j is palindromic, then the substring that starts i+1 to j-1 must be a palindrome.
  simple bool[][] array can determine which substrings are palindromic in O(n^2) time. Find the longest one and return.
