Q:
  Given a linked list, remove the nth node from the end of list and return its head.
  For example, 
     Given linked list: 1->2->3->4->5, and n = 2. 
     After removing the second node from the end, the linked list becomes 1->2->3->5.
  
  Given n will always be valid.
  Try to do this in one pass.
  
Notes:
  Consider edge situation:
    1. remove head
    2. remove tail
  Use if to judge or add a dummy head, whose next is the actuall head
